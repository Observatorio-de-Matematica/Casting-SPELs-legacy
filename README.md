# Casting-SPELs-legacy
Casting SPELs has been adapted to Maxima by Volker van Nek based on original Conrad Barski's LISP implementation.
The following is the page of the original Casting SPELs: https://www.lisperati.com/casting.html

# Legacy
This is some kind of the official game for Maxima, but some improvements can be made (some of the are "immediate").

No matter the programming language, some games can be implemented "everywhere" and Maxima is a general purpose Computer Algebra System.

Additionally, are two files intended to be part or be auxiliary to games; they are not complete, as far as i can see.

EHP_hybrid.mc give calculations related to the game Path of Exile.

uno.wxm tries to implement the card game UNO.

These files are placed here the same way they were left by their authors.
