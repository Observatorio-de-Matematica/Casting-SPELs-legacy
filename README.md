# Casting-SPELs-legacy
Casting SPELs has been adapted to Maxima by Volker van Nek based on original Conrad Barski's LISP implementation.
The following is the page of the original Casting SPELs: https://www.lisperati.com/casting.html

# Legacy
This is some kind of the official game for Maxima, but some improvements can be made (some of the are "immediate").
No matter the programming language, some games can be implemented "everywhere" and Maxima is a general purpose Computer Algebra System.
